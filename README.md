[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/yangosoft/corebroker.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/yangosoft/corebroker)

Corebroker is a custom message dispatcher based on TCP/IP server client architecture. Delivers JSON messages between nodes.

It's not production ready and it will never be. It's more a proof of concept.

A c++11 version is being developed under corebroker/corebroker and corebroker/corebroker_oldcpp contains a more mature c++98 version.
